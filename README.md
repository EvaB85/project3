##### Organization
- We used a trello board to keep track of tasks.
- We used slack a lot to communicate and send alerts for merging, etc.

##### Building Phase Summary
Jay put a lot of work into getting the Spotify API hooked up to our boilerplate site. He was also able to add on extra features related to Spotify later in our building phase.
Kacy created logic for taking the colors from the cloudinary API and generating "moods" that would correspond to songs pulled from Spotify.
Eva got the Cloudinary API connected with an upload box component.
Genevieve helped with a little bit of everything, especially when it came to writing the React components to tie everything together.

##### Testing/Debugging:
- We tested and debugged throughout the whole process
- Had a bugs section on our trello board so items could be added there
